ActsAsDebated
================

Based off of acts_as_rateable, this simplified rating system provides a +1 / -1 debate system on your model. The debated score is calculated by the sum of response scores.

Full rSpec suite is provided but you'll need to replace @model with an instance of one of your own models utilizing the mixin.

Example
=======
-------
Run the debateable_migration:
-------
script/generate debateable_migration
rake db:migrate

-------
Declare the mixin within a model of your choice:
-------
class MyTopic < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_debated
end

-------
Utilize the instance methods as you wish.
-------

MyTopic.create!(:name => 'test').debated_by?(user)       # => false
MyTopic.first.thumbs_up_from(user)                       # => #<Debateable id: ...
MyTopic.first.debated_score                              # => 1
MyTopic.first.thumbs_down_from(user)                     # => #<Debateable id: ...
MyTopic.first.debated_score                              # => -1
MyTopic.first.thumbs_down_from(another_user)             # => #<Debateable id: ...
MyTopic.first.debated_score                              # => -2
MyTopic.first.debated_by?(user)                          # => true
